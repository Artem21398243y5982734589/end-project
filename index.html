            Would you like to be?
            I'm trying to tell you something
            Something that I already said
            You like a pretty boy
            With a pretty voice
            Who is trying to sell you something
            Something that you already have
            But if you're too drunk to drive
            And the music is right
            She might let you stay
            But just for the night
            And if she grabs for your hand
            And drags you along
            She might want a kiss
            Before the end of this song
            Because love can burn like a cigarette
            And leave you alone with nothing
            And leave you alone with nothing
            While the others talk</p>

            Now you suck
            We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
            Well, you may not like it but you better learn how
            'Cause it's your turn now
            Boy, you're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
            Now, what's on your nasty old mind?
            So how should I begin this?
            I guess it started when you were with him
            And how he never even took you out to dance
            But did he fuck with any rhythm?
            But now he's playing with your head
            But did he ever make you cum?
            Did he ever make you cry?
            Do the wires in your mind get sewn together
            Rubbed and severed by the heat
            And you don't know how long I could stare into your picture
            And wish that it was me</p>

            She gave it a try she closed her eyes

            She just hoped that it wouldn't hurt

            They lie right to your face in this town

            She wishes that she could have
            Seen what they saw
            That left them so unimpressed
            So she gave it a try she started to cry
            She said to herself, "Well
            At least it could have been worse"
            And it almost worked</p>
